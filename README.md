1.  **Place Your Bet:** Before each hand, you'll place a wager from your starting balance.
2.  **The Deal:** You and the dealer will each receive two cards. One of the dealer's cards will be face down.
3.  **Player's Turn:** Look at your hand and decide whether to "Hit" (take another card) or "Stand" (keep your current hand).
    * You can hit multiple times, but if your hand's total exceeds 21, you "Bust" and lose your bet.
    * If you reach a total of 21 with your first two cards, you have "Blackjack!" (this usually pays out at 1.5 times your bet, provided the dealer doesn't also have Blackjack).
4.  **Dealer's Turn:** Once you stand or bust, the dealer reveals their face-down card.
    * The dealer must hit if their hand's total is less than 17.
    * The dealer must stand if their hand's total is 17 or more.
5.  **Determine the Winner:**
    * If your hand's total is higher than the dealer's (without busting), you win your bet.
    * If the dealer busts and you haven't, you win.
    * If you bust, you lose your bet.
    * If your hand's total is the same as the dealer's, it's a "Push," and you get your bet back.
    * If the dealer has Blackjack and you don't, you lose.
