Welcome to Office Blackjack!, the definitive blackjack experience on GitHub! I built Office BlackJack simply as a challenge to myself. I had used Python Tkinter frequency in my work to make simplistic applications for my team. After doing that for a few months I decided that I wanted to try to push Tkinter to its limits. I decided to make a full stack video game complete with unique animations, assets, and sound effects, and thus Office Blackjack was born.
