Welcome to Office Blackjack!, the definitive blackjack experience on GitHub! I built Office BlackJack simply as a challenge to myself. I had used Python Tkinter frequency in my work to make simplistic applications for my team. After doing that for a few months I decided that I wanted to try to push Tkinter to its limits. I opted to make a full stack video game complete with unique animations, assets, and sound effects, and thus Office Blackjack was born.

**The game comes with several innovative features:**

* A fully functional Blackjack game built with Python Tkinter.
* Custom-designed card assets and visually appealing interface.
* Sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
* Automatic installation of required libraries via a `.bat` configuration file.

**Basic Gameplay Features:**

* **Betting:** At the start of each round, you will be prompted to place a bet using the in-game interface. You can increase or decrease your bet within the allowed limits before the cards are dealt.
* **Hitting:** Once the initial cards are dealt, you have the option to "hit." This means you want to draw another card to increase your hand's total value. Be careful not to exceed 21!
* **Staying:** If you are satisfied with your hand's total value and do not want any more cards, you can choose to "stay." Once you stay, it's the dealer's turn to play.
* **New Game (Out of Money):** If your balance reaches zero, the game will automatically prompt you to start a new game, resetting your funds to the initial amount.

**Running the Configuration File:**

The `config.bat` file is designed to automatically install all the necessary Python libraries for Office Blackjack to run correctly. To execute it:

1.  Navigate to the directory where you have saved the `config.bat` file in your file explorer.
2.  Double-click the `config.bat` file.
3.  A command prompt window will appear, and the script will begin installing the required Python libraries (such as Tkinter, if needed, and any other dependencies).
4.  Wait for the script to finish. Once it's complete, you can close the command prompt window and run the main game file.
